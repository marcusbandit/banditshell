// STYLE: plates. A stack of index tabs, and the one you are on is pulled out.
//
// A workspace is not a number, it is the windows you left there, so each plate
// carries one mark per window. Nothing here is labelled 1..N: the column IS the
// order.
//
// LENGTH IS THE STATE, and it is the only thing that says it: a short mark for a
// workspace with nothing on it, further in when it holds windows, all the way out
// for the one you are on. Index tabs, and a bar chart of how busy the machine is,
// which turn out to be the same drawing. There is no separate indicator sliding
// around on top: the plate you go to IS the indicator, and it grows.
//
// THE PLATES BORDER THE SCREEN'S EDGE. They start at x = 0 and end flat there:
// this item spans the chassis's whole left band, and the band is shell material
// all the way out to the display, so a plate hinged at zero is hinged on the edge
// of the screen itself. They stop one band short of the bar's inner edge, so the
// free end has somewhere to be.
//
// Depth is thickness and layering, never a shadow or a bevel: an inactive plate
// is one sheet of material, the active one is two with the accent in the upper
// sheet, and it is longer than the rest. Where you are is literally more glass,
// pulled further out.
